              My yoga journey started when I was only 4 years old. Doing yoga as a child 
              was about meeting my friends, putting my imagination into play, but also finding 
              moments of stillness and concentration through guided meditations and stories.

              and sustainable movement practice that supports physical and mental wellbeing.
